# Player Particles

- __customize player particles for drag, land etc__

add a ui and use saved data system to make able u create own particles for basic player effects

- __.txt file "particle from string" loader__

u can create `EFFECT_NAME.txt` instead of `EFFECT_NAME.plist` to use **string system** instead xml dict. and also u can edit any other effect by that way.
